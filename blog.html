            <p class="answer">
                <LocalStorage>Local Storage :LocalStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save
                    key-value
                    pairs in a web
                    browser with no
                    expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser
                    window is
                    closed.
            </p>

            <p class="answer">Session Storage: The sessionStorage object stores data only for a session. It means that
                the data
                stored in the
                sessionStorage will be
                deleted when the browser is closed. A page session lasts as long as the web browser is open and survives
                over
                the page
                refresh</p>
