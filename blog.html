            <h1 class="question"> Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h1>
            <p class="answer">
                Local Storage : LocalStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save
                key-value
                pairs in a web
                browser with no
                expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser
                window is
                closed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="answer">Session Storage: The sessionStorage object stores data only for a session. It means that
                the data
                stored in the
                sessionStorage will be
                deleted when the browser is closed. A page session lasts as long as the web browser is open and survives
                over
                the page
                refresh.</p>

            <h1 class="question"> Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h1>
            <p class="answer">
                Global Scope : The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program
                executes by default. This scope
                includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined
                by a
                programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="answer">Block Scope : This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block,
                from access by the outside of the block. The
                let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.</p>

            <h1 class="question">What is Event loop in JavaScript?</h1>

            <p class="answer">Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until
                it receives
                more tasks. The
                event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no
                ongoing task. The
                event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises</p>

            <h1 class="question"> How do we get undefined in javascript?</h1>
            <p class="answer">
                1. A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
                <br>
                2. A method or statement also returns undefined if the
                variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.
                <br>
                3. A function returns undefined if a value was not
                returned.
